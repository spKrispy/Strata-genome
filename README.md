# Strata-genome

## "GenoCluster" is a groundbreaking project focused on leveraging genomic data for patient clustering and stratification. The initiative aims to dissect intricate genomic patterns to classify patients into distinct groups based on their molecular profiles. By employing advanced computational techniques and bioinformatics tools, GenoCluster seeks to identify underlying genetic signatures that can reveal valuable insights into disease susceptibility, progression, and treatment response.
